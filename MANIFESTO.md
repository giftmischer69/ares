(work in progress)

building habits and consistency

## Ease-of-use (android app)

- make it painless to track progress

## "Levelling up / gamification"

it's not a calendar (yet)

- dont want to replace a calendar for stuff
- just for daily / weekly tasks and **tracking progress**
can view statistics (like smoke tracking app)

## goals based on identities

(i am an athlete / i am a programmer / etc.)

when something is your identity you are more likely to do it

DO: i dont want to smoke, because **i'm not a smoker**

DONT: i dont want to smoke, i have a sore throat (or sth idk)

ConsistencyApp
Examine what stays the same every day (time to wake up, time to sleep, time of lunch, time of dinner, when to work out, when to meditate)
Consistency streaks are the goal
