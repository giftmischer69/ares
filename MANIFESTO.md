building habits and consistency

## Ease-of-use (android app)

- make it painless to track progress

## "Levelling up / gamification"

it's not a calendar (yet)

- dont want to replace a calendar for stuff
- just for daily / weekly tasks and **tracking progress**
can view statistics (like smoke tracking app)

## goals based on identities

(i am an athlete / i am a programmer / etc.)

when something is your identity you are more likely to do it

DO: i dont want to smoke, because **i'm not a smoker**

DONT: i dont want to smoke, i have a sore throat (or sth idk)
